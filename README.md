# Kappa Tea!

This is Starry Monlark's personal website, based on the [fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari/) template, which is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

The title is 偏微分茶会, or Partial Diffferential Tea Time.

Well, the name in English is a bit too long, and I'd rather call it *Kappa Tea!*, where *kappa* means the greek letter `κ`, and *kappa tea* sounds like some kind of misspelling of *cuppa tea (cup of tea)*.

For more details, please view the website's [About](https://www.monlark.top/about/) page and [Open Source Licenses](https://www.monlark.top/open-source-licenses/) page.
